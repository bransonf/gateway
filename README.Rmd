## Installation

You can install gateway from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/gateway")
```

## Useage
The package current has two functions for working with St. Louis neighborhood vectors - `nhood_num()` and `nhood_str()`. It also has a function `stdName()` for standardizing City of St. Louis street names (`FIRST` becomes `1st`, for example). You can view the database that `stdName()` by spening the `stdStreets` data included with the package.
